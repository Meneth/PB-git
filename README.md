#### What the modules do:
- `Gender Equality`: People of both genders can staff all council positions and command armies. All non-Muslim realms start with Absolute Cognatic succession
- `No Ahistorical Empires`: Only two empires have dejure land; Byzantium and the HRE
- `Shattered Balance`: All counties are independent. Perfect if you want alt-history or to expand as a specific dynasty. Note: Not compatible with No Assaults
