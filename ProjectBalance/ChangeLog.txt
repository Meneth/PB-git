	Robert of Apulia now starts with a moderately large force raised in Lecce

	It is no longer possible to start a claimant war while your liege is at war, as success causes any defensive wars your liege was involved in to end inconclusively
	Tuned down the severeness of most of the "recently conquered" modifiers. Provinces will no longer provide *no* levies and tax for 30 years
