3.5.15
	Baltic + finno-ugric cultural buildings now give heavy infantry and light infantry
	FIX: Cumbric cultural retinue and building added
	FIX: Several cultural building entries corrected for consistency errors
	FIX: Russian castle cultural buildings level 4 and 5 no longer give -150 heavy infantry when they should give -15
	FIX: "Is War Possible?" menu is now only available for Byzantines, because the answer is now, "Yes," to everyone else (no empty menu for non-Byzantines)
	FIX: Mending the Great Schism (Orthodox or Catholic) now requires only 75% religious authority (consistent with nerf to controlled-holy-sites bonus)

3.5.14
	Fixed the Imperial Reconquest war checks being impossible to toggle
	Tribal Invasion CB usage by non-Hordes limited to one usage per lifetime; Pagan Subjugation CB tied to same lifetime block (one or the other)
	FIX: Mongol generals won't spawn for the Khagan holding a Nerge unless he too is of Mongol culture
	FIX: Nerges can only be called by _independent_ characters [of Tengri religion and Altaic culture group] (vanilla bug) 
	FIX: Holy War CB properly enforces the Crown Authority restrictions for non-neighboring wars

3.5.13
	Embargo CBs have a proper description (vanilla bug)
	Embargo wars against a different-religion defender no longer award piety upon success
	Various Waylit siege event improvements: Should more carefully check to make sure you're actually at war with the person doing the sieging, deaths are now executions instead of dying in battle, siege winners should no longer execute folks they're trying to install as claimants, and siege hide/escape events should no longer fire unless it's your capital being sieged
	De jure county/barony claims against holy orders of the same religion are now allowed for the Byzantine / Roman Empire
	Religious Reconquest is no longer available to unreformed pagans
	Decommissioned religious_defense modifier, as it was not very effective (took effect after levies were raised) and was triggering for all wars
	Piety rewards/losses for winning/losing against a religious or heretic revolt reduced by 1/4 (50 piety for crushing the rebels)
	Croatian castle cultural building fixed
	All altaic cultures now have the turkish retinue (previously, they had none)
	No Ahistorical Empires scenario customization decision has been removed due to a vanilla bug to avoid confusion; manually invoking meneth.512 still works
	A ruler's first holy war now costs only 200 piety and then 300 piety thereafter

3.5.12
	It is no longer possible to press a third-party's claim on a holy order (vanilla succession bug generates random HO claims when it should generate none)
	Succession law opinions should now be properly applied to a ruler's family (this issue was also caused by a vanilla bug)
	Gender Equality module now properly removes crippling negative opinions (this issue was caused by a vanilla bug)
	Job ambitions now have the same restrictions as found in job_titles.txt
	Monks, Nuns, and the Celibate are now blocked from Wants Landed Title ambition
	Plot events and faction decisions updated, should allow antiking faction to function properly
	Reformed Tengri can now donate to and expel their holy order (vanilla bug fix)
	Tweaks to Religious Authority defines to better balance Sunnis, Shia, and prevent pathological Catholic downward spirals sparked by the inevitable antipope:
		AUTHORITY_FROM_ANTIPOPE = -0.2 (from -0.3)
		AUTHORITY_FROM_RELHEAD_HOLY_SITE = 0 (from 0.05)
		AUTHORITY_FROM_ORG_RELIGION = 0.3 (from 0.2, most balanced way to account for the loss due to PB's halved controlled-holy-sites bonus)
	Massive retinue + levy + cultural building rebalancing. Changes below that reference a SWMH culture are SWMH only.
		Many bonuses changed, centered around fixing Paradox's error of thinking buffing 2 troops of 250 guys each 30% is the same as buffing 1 troop of 500 guys 60%.
			Every mixed retinue has been significantly buffed as a result
		Pommeranians have North Germanic cultural building
		Hungarians and Romanians have Altaic cultural building
		Ethiopian cultural building gives archers
		North African and Bedouin unique retinues removed and merged with Arabic retinue; was causing overlap where many cultures got multiple cultural retinues
		Buildings that grant knights or horse archers updated to reflect new unnerfed maintenance cost
		Breton, Cornish, and Arpitan cultures now have a cultural building that produces knights
		North African cultures now have a cultural building
		Baltic and Finno-Ugric cultural building now grants large amounts of light infantry

		Croatians get unique cultural building for heavy infantry
		Karantanci, Bosnian, and Albanian cultures get the South Slavic cultural building
		Moravia gets the West Slavic cultural building

	Holy War now costs 300 piety to use, and rewards 1/2 the original piety
	Donating to holy orders generates 1/4 the original piety
	Winning battles against other religions generates 1/2 piety
	Opinion modifier for 'wrong government type' for count and higher vassals of different type (feudal/republic/theocracy) removed	
	Tribal invasion fixed (was unusable due to a bug), and put on the holy war cooldown timer
	Pagan reformation Religious Authority minimum reduced to account for other religious authority changes
	

3.5.11
	Due to a vanilla bug with tradeposts, bookmarks are now in chronological order
		NOTE: The vanilla bug is still present. Do not "go backward in time" in the lobby before starting your final game, and you can avoid the vanilla bug.
	(PB+SWMH) Fixed a parse error in realm_decisions.txt due to the lack of India
	Claimant faction wars no longer invalidate immediately after starting (introduced by 3.5.10)

3.5.10
	Fixed Crusade "showdown" timer event chain: Crusades properly unlock (takes no more than 10 years from the "Crusader Kings" event, if starting before the First Crusade)
	Patch 2.1.6 compatibility for major_revolt CBs (those involving a revolt title)

3.5.9
	Fixed it being impossible to gain the fighter and diplomat traits

3.5.8
	The il-Khanate AI shall no longer expand North into the Golden Horde's historical conquest trajectory
	Removed 'Randomize Rulers' scenario customization decision due to report of a crash
	Crusades will no longer almost instantly start after the scenario but require ~10-20 years before firing at later start dates [post-1103]
	Catholic Crusades and Muslim Jihad will no longer be called almost at the same instant for later start dates when Crusades are already unlocked
		Instead, their respective activations will be randomly staggered
	Halved the moral authority gained from the religious head's piety
	Halved the moral authority gained from holding holy sites
	Catholics mending the schism will no longer block them from starting Crusades [bnormoyle]
	Made the Pope ask for Papal Investiture less often
	Maintenance for heavy cavalry is no longer so disproportionately high
	Added four diplomacy traits similar to the fighter traits. These can be gained in childhood and provide a boost to diplomacy

3.5.7
	Added Jewish and Nahuatl cultural buildings
	(PB+SWMH) Updated cultural buildings
	Restored vanilla tournaments (at least until the New Duel Engine version is fixed)
	[Major Fix] Upon title grant, the succession laws of the grantee are now properly applied to the granted title
	Gavelkind succession law now instantly takes effect for barony-tier titles. Previously there was game-time delay before hard-code enforced it

3.5.6
	Standard demesne laws now locked-out for temporary titles (e.g., revolt, liberation, or duchy adventurer titles)
	MARRIAGE_TIER_DIFF_PRESTIGE_MULT dropped to 75 from 125 (-40% change, -25% from vanilla)
		AI reasoning factor MARRIAGE_AI_PRESTIGE_VALUE remains at significantly emphasised value of 0.75 (+127% from vanilla's 0.33)
	Summer fair event chain fix
	Converting to your capital's religion no longer requires you to be pious, but still reduces your piety

3.5.5
	Mending the schism as a catholic now always requires a catholic to hold the Hagia Sophia, even if there's no Orthodox empire in existence. This should make mending the schism considerably rarer
	Properly localised Novgorod events and made some other localisation flavor adjustments
	Holy war no longer vassalizes anyone not of your religion; they're once more conquered outright. Note that Pagans have a decision from vanilla that makes them convert and invalidates holy war
	Removed some coats of arms that already exist in vanilla
	Upon crusade/jihad/GHW success, free any vassalized holy orders which do not match the winner's religion. Previously, they'd essentially become stuck forever under, e.g., the winner of a Jihad, if they were vassals of Jerusalem beforehand (unable to be hired by any religion and possibly giving a Caliphate vassal baronies randomly located throughout Catholic Europe)
	The Catholic schism mending event is now more efficient and will notify other rulers as is appropriate for such a momentous occasion; in addition, zealous Orthodox rulers will now always refuse conversion and cynical rulers will always convert
	The employment decisions are now hidden by default, with a toggle decision to show them
	Unlike other military buildings, the cultural buildings no longer reduce tax income
	Updated PB's culture buildings to correspond with current maintenance values
	[PB+SWMH] Fixed the French HRE displaying as e_hre_french rather than Holy Roman Empire
	Fixed an error in the requirements for forming Tartaria
	Reduced the maintenance cost for retinues by 20%
	Various localisation fixes
	Complete, native Spanish translation of PB [many thanks and credit to tu_79]
	Fixed several small bugs in Waylit siege events

3.5.4
	Fixed a few kingdoms incorrectly remaining parts of dejure empires when No Ahistorical Empires is enabled
	[PB+SWMH] Fixed bookmarks after 1215 crashing the game
	Tweaks to strengthen event chain leading to / incl. Formation of Rum
	Major bugfix: Crusades now transfer titles appropriately after success. Some reported holy war issues may also have been caused by the same bug and may be resolved now
	Random-courtier-killing maintenance event is now a little less overzealous
	Some minor performance tweaks
	AI requirements for creating retinues slightly hightened: their realm_sizes must now be just a bit bigger (18 if independent, 24 if a vassal-- +3 holdings to each)
	Disabled vanilla RoI's somewhat excessive conversion of rulers to local province culture by AI decision [issue only affected those with RoI enabled]
	New crusader states now properly refill de jure holding levies upon success; only part of the job was getting done
	Fixed bug where a Catholic Byzantine/Roman Emperor that has vassalized the Pope would occasionally lose the Pope as a vassal as a result of Imperial Reconquest
	Fixed bug wherein Immortal trait would be lost upon reloading a save or converting to a different religion (at the least)
	Loosened the restrictions upon vassalizing the Knights Templar or Knights Hospitaler as a holder of the Kingdom of Jerusalem; made decision immune to temporary revolt titles
	
3.5.3
	Updated to comply with 2.1.3
	Fixed the Norman Company not having any soldiers
	The Shia Caliphate can no longer gain dejure territory via assimilation
	Fixed Gujurati culture references broken due to spelling change [AnaxXiphos]
	The player should now be forced out of the Autonomy faction if they decide to stay loyal to their liege instead of revolting
	Finally fixed the pathologically unstable English (Anglo-Saxon vs. Norman vs. Norwegian) AI outcome at the Stamford Bridge start.  The AI now efficiently ferries William's troops across the Channel instead of killing them off one regiment at a time and skipping Hastings (still may need troop balancing)
	Fixed some retinues with horse arches not actually having horse archers
	Fixed Imperial Reconquest referring to a couple of titles that no longer exist in PB
	Upon Christian Crusade creation, the Pope now loses all his excess piety and cash until it's returned to him 2 and 1 months into the Crusade, respectively. The Pope will no longer snap up all the holy orders right away, and in general, will be much less likely to be the Crusade winner instead of a proper Catholic ruler
	Removed PB's penalty to Muslim merchant republics' income, as it is no longer needed now that the Indian Ocean is a separate ocean
	Moved the useless courtier maintenance event to on_actions for improved performance [AnaxXiphos]
	Further performance improvements to useless courtier mass-murder
	Added a proper AI retinue spam filter to PB with the following requirement for hiring a retinue:
		tier >= duke and { tier >= king OR { independent AND realm_size >= 15 } OR realm_size >= 21 }
		NOTE: realm_size is the number of holdings in a ruler's [sub]realm, their demesne's holdings plus all direct and indirect vassals' holdings
		Restriction _only affects AI_, as the AI otherwise spams useless, do-nothing retinue units literally all over the map
	Removed previous retinue disabler system [building and maintenance-event based] in favor of 2.1's retinue hire triggers. Further improves performance from the heightened AI restrictions and also perfects consistency / immediate correctness
	Fixed a few duplicate title IDs
	Fixed some references to nonexistent titles in CBs and history
	Updated the AF to workaround some of the complications of the 2.1 faction changes; one big change: AFs of vassal kings (who are themselves in an AF) are no longer permitted
	Added a number of 2.1 sanity checks to the codebase as a result of a major bug sweep
	Added some additional 2.1.2 changes [AnaxXiphos]
	Crusade kingdom give-away event series now properly executes for Fraticelli Popes that have called a successful Crusade
	Upon Crusade success, deserting soldiers that decide to settle in the target kingdom immediately refill the kingdom's holding levies. Will improve early survival of Crusader States.
	Tweaked decisions for vassalization of the Knights Templar and/or Knights Hospitalier as the King of Jerusalem 

3.5.2
	Updated for 2.1
	Fixed Mandé culture not existing
	Fixed some missing localisation
	Fixed a few errors in Ethiopia and Egypt

3.5.1
	Fixed the duchy of Aktobe being a vassal of Cumania rather than the Kipchaks
	(PB+SWMH) Eased the requirements for the events for Castille expanding dejure. Now they'll expand dejure into Toledo once they control all their starting dejure territory, and into La Mancha once they completely control Toledo. Previously complete control of Toledo/La Mancha was required for each event to fire
	Made the holy war requirements clearer by simplifying how the requirements are displayed. The requirements remain the same, but it should now be more obvious what's preventing holy war
	Fixed the Greek-Sicilian melting pot in Sicily not working if No Ahistorical Empires was enabled
	Fixed a number of issues in Ethiopia, and some issues in the Low Lands and Iberian, introduced by the map change in 3.5.0
	Added impassable mountains around Cilicia to make it more resilient to foreign conquerors
	Fixed Burgundy not being eligible for Imperial Reconquest

3.5.0
	Dropped all provinces PB adds. The map will from now on have the exact same provinces as vanilla, though borders may be tweaked. Breaks non-SWMH saves
	Base chance of gaining combat trait advancement XP increased by 25% (return to original weight)
	Global cleanup event added to auto-remove do_not_disturb flag on characters that have had it set, due to some errant event chain logic (seemingly vanilla at present) that never clears it after setting it, for at least 60 consecutive days
	Improved flavor for Catholics mending the schism [AnaxXiphos]

3.4.6
	Reduced the size of Robert of Apulia's starting forces somewhat
	(No Ahistorical Empires) Fixed Adal and Maghreb being part of dejure empires in SWMH
	Battlefield duels now work properly again: reverted the integrated New Duel Engine to its previous version (pre-3.4.1 PB). Kept the new-style combat trait icons originally from AnaxXiphos
	Until the code can be analysed in-depth and cleared for take-off, "Hold a Grand Tournament" is now disabled (related to NDE revert) due primarily to potentially critical side effects with the do_not_disturb character flag
	Lowered warscore from battles by 1/6th
	The slowed down spread of culture in the HRE and Byzantine Empire now specifically target German/Greek culture
	Slowed down the spread of German culture in the decentralized HRE further (3 times as long as normal, up from 2.5)
	Made the AI more likely to use the holy war CB if it meets the requirements
	(PB+SWMH) Fixed a few Iberian events not firing when they should
	Increased the penalties for marrying below your rank to 125 (from 100)
	Made the AI more hesitant to marrying below their rank
	Fix to long-time, heavily misleading success effect tooltip for Imperial Reconquest CB
	Fix and clarification of success effect tooltip for Invasion CB
	Special invasion CBs which use vanilla BATTLE_WARSCORE_WORTH as a special-case for improved stability of plausible outcomes updated to reflect the -16.7% reduction in global BATTLE_WARSCORE_WORTH
	Much more complete success effect tooltip for Viking Invasion CB
	Duchy Adventurers now gain any occupied target titles upon their [rare] success, consistent with the rest of the CB's mechanics, tooltips, and purpose
	Imperial Reconquest CB now also vassalizes or takes under the target duchy any bishropics that are de facto vassals of the Papacy; counteracts a side-effect of an SoA event which transfers a number of AI Catholic rulers' bishops' vassalage directly to the Pope, preventing potential decades of repeated wars with the Papacy for one bishropic at a time

3.4.5
	Added a set of tiered conquest checks for the Imperial Reconquest CB under the "Is war possible?" menu. Now works for both PB and PB+SWMH (only the latter in the previous release)
	Flawed bankruptcy triggered modifier from previous release removed. No extra land_morale hit when bankrupt now, but most importantly, no rapidly-toggling "Lack of Funds" notification in your High Priority Messages tab
	(Gender Equality) Fixed a case where certain characters could be upset at rulers due to their startup succession law change to True Cognatic
	Day-1 scenario customization decisions prioritized to top of intrigue menu. Some "high-priority" decisions that can't actually be executed on day 1 anyway will now only show up after the first game day (e.g., Hold a Grand Tournament). Later saves will always be after day 1 (and the scenario customization options disappear by then), so those decisions are all still available before unpausing in the normal case of loading a game
	(No Ahistorical Empires) The Bulgarian Empire is now properly removed upon enacting the scenario customization decision in the 867 start date
	Vanilla trait AI weighting tweaks. AI behavior due to traits should be slightly more ambitious and willing to take risks but generally more accurately reflect trait semantics.
	Bugfix for issue that prevented the autonomy faction from ever actually succeeding at commending their liege when in a happy mood despite a successful vote in favor. Faction leader was hogging the glory and commending himself without even checking the vote results, as it turns out.
	Introduction of the new Day-1 (or, D-Day, alternately) scenario customization decison 'Randomize Rulers,' which assigns a new, random face to all historical rulers and their courtiers worldwide.  They will receive a new, highly realistic, and coherent set of random personality, education, leadership, and genetic traits. New family traits which arise will also potentially be inherited by all living descendants. Project Balance features a significantly extended trait set, so startup characters can now benefit from all of them. Will fundamentally alter the political landscape for a fresh experience that leaves the worldwide balance of power and other expectations of your selected scenario fully intact. Icon by AnaxXiphos
	Added new Immortal trait icon [AnaxXiphos]

3.4.4
	(PB+VIET) Fixed some trait icons being missing when VIET Immersion is active
	Fixed an issue with pushing the claims of vassals/courtiers
	Updated employment decision icons, changed more event pictures, added icon for Imperial Reconquest check [AnaxXiphos]
	(PB+SWMH) Fixed an issue with the Imperial Reconquest CB
	Bugfix for immediately-invalidated Muslim Invasion CB; muslim-vs.-muslim invasion (due to hostile denomination) is now 60% more expensive than vanilla to wage and more difficult to qualify, but all other cases mirror vanilla
	Updated the implementation of Sniggles' Bookmarks to the latest version
	The Yazidi Caliphate and Ibadi Imamate, if they are created, may now also use the Caliphal Subjugation CB
	(PB+SWMH) A comprehensive set of conquest checks has been added for the Imperial Reconquest CB under the "Is war possible?" menu. It should now be much more straightforward to traverse the CB's tiers. Regular PB support for the same will follow
	Bankruptcy triggered modifier re-enabled: A negative balance at the turn of the month will hit you with -0.25 land_morale so long as the balance remains negative
	AI loan-taking: More aggressive and deterministic when in need, waits to reach a more negative threshold than a zero balance, avoids bankruptcy triggered modifier

3.4.3
	Bugfix for Jewish players not being able to take loans via the decisions menu. AI Jews could still take loans
	Autonomy faction is now guaranteed to not be created by the AI for 6 months after game startup. This allows a player vassal plenty of time to start the faction (i.e., be the leader) if they so desire. Ideally, the faction will become even more democratic in future releases, but the leader currently plays a pivotal role in setting the agenda of meetings
	Minor flavor improvements: Changed a bunch of event pictures, added varied death causes to the useless courtier killing event, added new hourglass modifier icons, tweaked event modifier icon choices, improved localisations for pagan subjugation CB and Become King ambition [AnaxXiphos]
	Decision icon improvements: Updated all icons except employment [AnaxXiphos]
	Whenever your children are not in your court (e.g., as a result of a political marriage) and lack a good reason for it, you will be alerted with the decision to bring them home. Rank restrictions apply to multiplayer. Icon by AnaxXiphos
	Guardian events: fixed those that assume age of adulthood is 16 and that child was actually part of liege's court, increased likelihood of a good candidate for guardianship when vassals offer, increased delay before a vassal offers to mentor your newly-6-year-old child (fewer and less annoying popups), and so on
	Ensured that the crusade target is always destroyed if it cannot be usurped and the war target holds the title
	(PB+SWMH) Fixed there being no centers of trade
	Ported depose_antipope and cb_install_antiking casus belli as well as the Anti-King Faction from vanilla
	Ankara falling to Muslims will no longer trigger the Crusades, seeing as it fell in 1071 historically without triggering anything
	Different religious heads cannot call crusades for the same title simultaneously
	Upon winning a crusade, the Pope, mercenary bands, and holy orders now always grant the crusader state to a new, highborn ruler with no possible inheritance ties to elsewhere. Other AI winners are still more likely to grant it to a secondary son, brother, relative, etc., although they never keep it for themselves
	All de jure titles within a crusade (or jihad) target kingdom and within the realm of the defending ruler should now always be transferred to the crusade winner, regardless of whether they were involved in a revolt against the defending ruler at the time of crusade success.
	A lot of internal changes to the crusade/jihad casus belli: mechanics now differ for Jihads in one notable case (if the target kingdom has not yet been created or the title has been destroyed and the most participating attacker is the initiating Caliph, they will now actually create the target title like Catholics)
	Gavelkind succession faction CB now has a consistent 5-year truce and missing AI victory/defeat worth weights (reporting credit goes to AnaxXiphos)
	The CB other_succession_on_liege (third-party pushing a succession claim against his liege) now properly converts the claimant to feudal type (vs. clergy, e.g.), whenever appropriate (reporting credit goes to AnaxXiphos)
	Fixed an issue with the CB description localisation/text for Muslim County Conquest (reporting credit goes to AnaxXiphos)
	Very slightly buffed new crusader state formation; added consistency, flavor, and fixes
	Fixed tribal invasion cb not allowing Mongols to invade non-Mongols
	Whenever a crusade/jihad is won and the crusade/jihad target kingdom changes hands or is newly created, all of the new realm's succession laws are now guaranteed to be appropriately feudal
	For most crusade targets, the AI will use and automatically convert the religion of the kingdom's de jure capital
	Fixed an issue causing religious enemies not to be recognized for the purpose of bypassing the alliance restrictions on some CBs
	Improved the localisation of the requirements for enacting tanistry
	Added new icons for the gender laws, including Enatic-Cognatic and Enatic which both had no icon, by AnaxXiphos
	"Blinded" is now considered a health trait, which for example means it'll prevent you from conducting grand hunts

3.4.2
	Shattered Balance, No Ahistorical Empires, and Gender Equality can now be enabled in-game before first unpausing the game
	(PB+SWMH) Fixed three provinces in Ethiopia having no holdings
	Reduced PB's across the board fertility penalty to 5% (from 10%)
	(PB+SWMH+NBRT+) Fixed an issue where movement involving a few specific provinces would take months rather than days
	Fixed mismatched localisation for autonomy faction military vs. economic cooperation (they were doing the opposite of what they informed you)
	Autonomy faction military and economic cooperation now effect the entire subrealm of each faction member, providing a small but significant realm-level boost to the military or economic might of faction members relative to their liege. A bit more danger for the liege and yet also good for his/her realm if the faction votes for it
	The autonomy faction factor from legalism tech now ranges from 0 to 8 instead of -2 to 6
	Improved the localisation for some CB requirement localisation
	Fixed Muslim city vassal request event so it works properly when city obligations are set to maximum [AnaxXiphos]
	Members of the Autonomy faction that have been coerced by their liege's spymaster will now always vote in their liege's favor when it comes to negative actions. They will never vote for the angry faction mood
	(PB+SWMH) Fixed Imperial Reconquest not working in the French tier
	Crown law revocation via faction ultimatums or _any kind_ of revolt now induce a cooldown period of 15 years before a crown law may again be revoked via such a mechanism. NOTES: If a claimant of any kind usurps the throne, all CA sliders are reduced regardless of any cooldown, and if present, it's removed. If the liege is deposed, overthrown, or replaced due to a succession war and all CA sliders are reduced due to lack of cooldown protection, a new cooldown period starts for the new liege. Finally, the cooldown is removed from a title if the liege grants it to a new ruler
	Fixed double-abdication bug with the autonomy faction's abdication ultimatum (child pretenders on the throne, anyone?)
	Various minor bugfixes for the autonomy faction
	Successful faction revolts that revoke crown laws no longer "use-up" the liege's once-in-a-lifetime right to change a crown law, if he/she hadn't already changed one beforehand. This was already the case for some faction revolts and is now consistent
	Regular factions (non-autonomy) will now now wait to submit a revolt ultimatum until after their liege is no longer using ANY of the 3 holy war CBs in PB
	Moderate nerf of the feudal elective faction. The faction is generally more tolerant than the other succession law factions, more easily dissuaded/coerced, less subject to transient issues which will definitely be solved-- at least by the AI-- in due time, and generally slower to jump to an ultimatum. Testing shows that it's quite possible, e.g., for an AI France to avoid an overwhelming elective faction revolt within 5 years of the 1066 start (previously a problem) but that the faction still remains a threat in those scenarios
	Autonomy faction event text overhauled to add flavor and be read from a first-person perspective like other CKII events
	Autonomy faction now highly unlikely to call a meeting while their liege is in the middle of a large-scale offensive war such as a crusade, invasion, or holy war; actual tolerated delay and chance of a meeting being called anyway past a certain point vary by the war's casus belli

3.4.1
	Updated the implementation of the New Duel Engine to its latest version
	Combat/fighter traits (for the duel engine) are again customizable in the Ruler Designer
	Added combat trait advancement (CTA) system for adult rulers under 50 (and their marshals). Earn experience points toward trait level-up via personal participation in battles and all types of victorious duels. Dramatically decrease the time taken to advance by applying yourself toward the new, associated set of ambitions. Age, skill tier, and traits will also impact your rate of progress. You may only advance 1 level beyond that with which you reach adulthood. In the exceptional case that you start with no combat education whatsoever, then you are allowed to advance up to 2 levels.
	Added swanky ambition icon for all four CTA ambitions (credit goes to AnaxXiphos)
	The starting trade posts are now built by event rather than using the history files, simplifying maintenance of PB, and reducing the chance of bugs
	Fixed the Autonomy faction being able to demand a county be given away when their liege was under, rather than over, the demesne limit
	(PB+SWMH) Tweaks to culture/religion in the Caucasus
	Hamburg now has a tier 2 center of trade
	Merged the loans from Jewish bankers with PB's system. Main difference is that expelling Jews now frees one from PB's loans, and that loans are inherited by one's heir. The AI will now also take loans if bankrupt
	Stewardship now reduces the interest charged on loans by 1% per 5 stewardship, capping out at a 3% reduction (7% interest rate)
	It is now possible to repay half a loan (except 100g loans) if the size of loan below it is available. E.G., if you've got a 400g loan but no 200g loan you can repay 200g of the 400g loan
	AI loan-taking and loan-repayment are now much more prompt, esp. when at war (inversely so for repayment during war)

3.4.0
	Added a new faction system. All crown authority factions have been merged into a single faction that is more responsive to the actions of their liege, and have more actions they can take. Every 3 to 7 years they hold a meeting to determine what action they'll take. If they're in a bad mood they might issue an ultimatum to their liege, but if treated well they will not be much of a threat. They're potentially a much greater threat than the old factions however, as the faction is global to the realm rather than specific to a single dejure kingdom or empire
	Fixed a few minor event bugs
	Made the requirements for Tribal Invasions more obvious
	Got rid of nearly all flags in PB that exist in vanilla. Most of them were grandfathered in from North African Expansion or the Lotharinga and Lowlands mod.

	Shortened crown law descriptions to prevent/reduce text overflow

	Applied the increased levy cost via a multiplier (new in CKII 2.0) rather than as direct maintenance. As a result, most units now cost a bit less retinue cap, while general maintenance is mostly the same
	Increased the overall liege levy multiplier to 100% (from 75%)
	Reduced the severity of liege levy drop-off based on dejure status (70%, 60%, 50%, 40% instead of 100%, 75%, 50%, 35%, 25%). Overall levies will be roughly the same for small rulers, and slightly higher for large rulers

	Reduced the cultural flexibility modifier from technology to 30% (from 40%)
	Tweaked opinion penalities from crown levies

	Culture buildings no longer reduce the number of heavy cavalry available
	Doubled the prestige requirements for enacting Primogeniture

	Added a new CB: Religious Reconquest. Lets you attack any duchy with 1 or more province of your religion that is held by a ruler of another religion. Usable as long as you either border the target or you're two or less sea zones away. This CB outright conquers the target duchy
	Added a new CB: Special Holy War. This CB is only given to Jerusalem and a few holy orders, letting them bypass requirements in certain circumstances (Teutonic Order against Pagans, Knights Hospitallier/Templar against Muslims, Jerusalem against their dejure provinces). This CB outright conquers the target duchy

	Robert of Apulia now starts with a moderately large force raised in Lecce

	It is no longer possible to start a claimant war while your liege is at war, as success causes any defensive wars your liege was involved in to end inconclusively
	Tuned down the severeness of most of the "recently conquered" modifiers. Provinces will no longer provide *no* levies and tax for 30 years
	Added some events that makes Pecheneg provinces Vlach if the Pechenegs get conquered by a non-Altaic culture. Credit goes to neondt

	Rulers won't get the Holy War CB for free (due to same-religion provinces) against the Rum Sultanate. If the other conditions are met, Holy War can still be declared
	The Rum Sultanate gets a large boost to religious conversion until year 1200
	The Sultan of Rum gets a modifier for 10 years after the formation of Rum which makes them immune to holy wars and gives them some temporary bonuses, making it more likely for them to survive (especially considering half their provinces will have "recently conquered" modifiers)
	The Ghilman mercenary band is transfered to Rum upon its formation

3.1.11
	Ensured that if the Crusade target is given away, it remains Feudal
