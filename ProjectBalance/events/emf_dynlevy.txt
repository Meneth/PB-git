# CB supplement to adjust both the dynlevy laws associated with ROOT and FROMFROM
# It is called on the attacker (thus FROM in the CB becomes FROMFROM here)

# This is intended for major_revolt CBs, for application upon revolt start and end.
# Note that we adjust the title laws immediately, unlike the title transfer listeners.
#
# In PB, this does nothing.
