# the following effects/triggers exists (example execution order: on_success->on_success_title->on_success_posttitle):
# is_valid, is_valid_title, on_add, on_add_title, on_add_posttitle, on_success, on_success_title, on_success_posttitle, on_fail, on_fail_title, on_fail_posttitle, on_reverse_demand, on_reverse_demand_title, on_reverse_demand_posttitle
#
# Added on_attacker_leader_death, on_defender_leader_death and on_thirdparty_death, which all trigger when corresponding character dies
# These three all have war scopes, which currently has the following scope changes: 
# attacker, defender, thirdparty(only valid if thirdparty character is involved), thirdparty_title(only valid if thirdparty title is involved)
#
# ai_will_do: modifies value AI places on the CB compared to other CBs (default: 1)
# can_use_gui: If otherwise valid, the CB is listed in the Diplo View, but you can't declare war unless 'can_use_gui' is also valid (also shows a trigger tooltip.)


# If the Sultanate of Rum forms, the Byzantines will later usually get the chance to attempt to retake the coast
# This CB cannot be used at any other time. It will cause every coastal county held by Rum in the dejure Byzantine empire 
# to revert to Byzantine control. Failure (not white peace) to retake the coast will cause the Byzantines to lose their
# dejure claims to Anatolia, and all of Anatolia bar Cilicia will become dejure Rum
