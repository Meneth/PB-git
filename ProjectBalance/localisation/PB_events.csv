meneth.200.desc;Welcome to Project Balance. This event is here to set up the campaign and to give you a brief introduction to Project Balance. \nProject Balance is much more minimalist than most major mods. Instead of trying to remake the game I've made tweaks in order to make the game both more enjoyable and more historically plausible.\nMake sure to check the "is war possible?" decision to see if you meet the restrictions. \nIf you encounter any issues or have any questions or feedback you can contact me in Project Balance's thread on the Paradoxplaza forums. Alternatively you can send me a PM on Paradoxplaza or on reddit. \nI hope you'll enjoy the mod, \n- Meneth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

meneth.204.desc;We've just won a kingdom in a Crusade. We could choose to keep the kingdom for ourselves or we could give it to someone else in our family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

meneth.206.desc;The pious are rewarded for their efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.206.a;OK;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.208.desc;For whatever reason, you hold a kingdom or empire that has no Internal Peace law. Perhaps you recently formed an empire, and the game thus didn't give you Emperor's Peace, or perhaps you're an emperor who formed a kingdom. Either way, this event should fix that for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.209.desc;It appears that refusing the Pope wasn't a good idea. He has decided to excommunicate us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

meneth.217.desc;The laws of your realm prevent you from instituting anything but minimal obligations from your vassals. Your demesne laws have therefore been returned to minimum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.219.desc;It is time for a faction meeting. We will determine what action to take, if any, once we know how everyone feels about our liege's rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.220.desc;A faction meeting has begun, and the first point on the agenda is determining how the faction as a whole feels about our liege's rule. What is your opinion of their rule?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

meneth.400.b;I'd rather not;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.401.desc;A member of our dynasty has established himself in a position of power in Anatolia. Perhaps it would be best to let him rule Anatolia independently?.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.401.a;Very well;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.402.desc;The formation of the Rum Sultanate provides us with the perfect opportunity to declare independence from the empire. If we petition the emperor for independence he will likely grant our request as he knows it'll be almost impossible to project his power here now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.402.a;Petition for independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.403.desc;The rulers of Cilicia and Antioch have petitioned me for independence. Their lands are of course part of my realm by right, but I'm not sure I've actually got the means to keep them obedient. Granting them independence would be admitting that we cannot reconquer our lost lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

meneth.406.desc;We've achieved independence by military means!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.407.desc;We are in a prime position to further extend our dominion over Anatolia. It is time we took the rest of this peninsula.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.408.desc;We've successfully taken the rest of Anatolia, only the city of Trapezous still resists our dominion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.409.desc;We've lost Anatolia, but we can still reclam the coast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.410.desc;The emperor tried to take our rightful lands, but we repelled his attempt. Our dominion over Anatolia is now clear to all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.411;Formation of Rum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.411.desc;With the Byzantine armies crushed by the Turks, Turkish warlords have exploited the power vacuum left by the Byzantine retreat. \nThey have managed to gain near complete control over the Anatolian peninsula. A dark shadow looms over the future of the once great empire; will foreign invaders and internal trouble spell its doom, or will it persevere through it all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.411.b;This can only mean trouble;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.411.c;Even once great empires may fall;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.412.desc;Ensures that Armenia isn't dejure Byzantine when it shouldn't be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.413.desc;The Bulgarians have long been a thorn in our side. Now, as a result of the Rumites taking much of our rightful land they have become brave enough to actively resist our rule. They demand increased autonomy or they will make our rule hell. If we deny them it might make other groups troublesome as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

meneth.413.c;Give them some autonomy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

meneth.416.desc;The Emperor has decided to ignore the Bulgarian demands for autonomy, and as a result there is now constant unrest amongst the Bulgarian population. Members of other ethnic groups have used this as an opportunity to express their discontent with the empire. We can expect this unrest to leave a lasting impact on the empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.416.a;This concerns us greatly as our lands are affected;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.416.b;Luckily our lands remain unaffected;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.417.desc;The Emperor has decided to grant the Bulgarians significant autonomy within the empire, placating them. For now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.418.desc;The Bulgarians are rising against our rule, and war is inevitable unless we give into their demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.418.a;Give them independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.418.b;To war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.419.desc;Have some free troops;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.423.desc;Now that we have managed to retake all of Iconium our rightful rule of all of Anatolia is once more recognized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.428.desc;Now that we have held onto the position of emperor for several years our Bulgarian kin has come to understand that the reasons for their unrest have come to an end. This can only be good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.420.desc;We now hold the kingdom of Galicia, but there is no prestige in holding this title, so it shall be lost to the annals of history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.421;Quest to Reclaim the Holy Land;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

meneth.426.desc;With the Magyars settled in the Carpathian Basin, we can now move away from our enemies into their former territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.427;Holy Roman Empire formed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.427.desc;A new empire has been formed from German and Italian lands, claiming it is the one true successor to Rome. It is a decentralized realm, but still one that could potentially rise to greatness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.437.desc;A new empire has been formed from French and Italian lands, claiming it is the one true successor to Rome. It is a decentralized realm, but still one that could potentially rise to greatness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

meneth.502.desc;Do you want to enable special Casus Belli that make conquest much easier? This will also remove all restrictions on holy war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.503.desc;Do you want all merchant republics destroyed?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.504.desc;Do you want to make all counties Feudal? Won't affect merchant republics if you chose not to destroy them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.506.desc;Do you want to have lucky AI realms? If you click yes three random AI rulers (one Christian, one Muslim, and one Pagan) will become ambitious, get 500 gold, 250 prestige, 100 piety, and a free 3000-man army. You will get the choice to add three completely random lucky AIs after that. You'll be able to add as many as you want, though 3 to 12 is recommended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

meneth.507.desc;Do you want to have three more lucky AI realms? If you click yes three random AI rulers will become ambitious, get 500 gold, 250 prestige, 100 piety, and a free 3000-man army. You will get the choice to add another three random lucky AIs. 3 to 12 is recommended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.509.desc;You've got some armies you're not supposed to have. They will now be despawned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.510.desc;Do you want to make all rulers immortal? This will also kill any dyasty members that aren't rulers and make the rulers infertile, and will enable an event causing an immortal to take over if there's any independent non-immortal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.510.a;Only make me immortal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

meneth.601;The Baqt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.601.desc;The Baqt was an agreement between the Ethiopian kingdom of Makuria and the Muslim rulers of Egypt. In exchange for free trade between the peoples, they were to live in peace with one another. Maintaining the Baqt provides safety and revenue, but prevents expansion. An ambitious ruler can seek to violate the Baqt and earn power through war rather than trade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
