BM_HUNGARY;Hungary-Croatia;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_HUNGARY_DESC;The death of the Ilyena Árpád, the childless Queen of Croatia, passes her Kingdom on to her brother László, King of Hungary. The union of Hungary-Croatia brings strength to the Magyars, but will László and this new-formed Baltic union be able to stand the test of time? Elsewhere in the world, Yusuf Almoravid, Sultan of Mauretania, has begun uniting the peoples of North Africa and southern Iberia. He seeks to contest--and if possible, reverse--the conquests that the kingdom of León-Castille has managed against the Muslims of Iberia.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
BM_THE_ISLES;King of Dublin and the Isles;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_THE_ISLES_DESC;Gudrød Crovan, of both Norwegian and Irish descent, has finally succeeded in expanding his Kingdom of Mann and the Isles to include his birthright, the Kingdom of Dublin. The day of the Norwegian conquerors is over, dead with the failure of Harald Hårdråde at Stamford Bridge, but Gudrød Crovan believes in turning back that clock. From his foothold in Dublin, he seeks to expand and name himself Ard Rí ua Éire, High King of Ireland. But Gudrod is not without other troubles. He holds lands that Malcolm Dunkeld calls his own, and the Scottish king will not back down from his own birthright easily.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
BM_NORWAY_1;The Collapse of the Isles;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_NORWAY_1_DESC;The Kingdom that Gudrød Crovan worked his entire life to create is no more. Dead of the plague, Gudrød's Kingdom has fractured. While King Magnus III of Norway has reasserted hegemony over much of Gudrød's old land, Galloway and Dublin have both declared independence from the Norwegian King. The north of Albion lies in flux: will Magnus be able to avenge his defeated grandfather the Hårdråde and terrorise the shores of Albion once again, or will Edgar, the young King of Scotland, be able to use this transition to his advantage?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BM_EDGE_OF_KNIFE;The Edge of the Knife;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_EDGE_OF_KNIFE_DESC;The Western World stands upon the edge of a knife. In Iberia, the Almoravid Sultanate is nearing total victory, with Alfonso of León-Castilla barely holding on to the north of España, and the Kingdom of Aragón-Navarra and the Duchy of Barcelona barely surviving at the French border. Across the Mediterranean, although the Komnenoi have taken the throne and fight valiantly against the Turk, Sultan Kilij Arslan holds much of Anatolia under his grasp, and looks with greedy eyes toward the independent Duchy of Armenia Minor. Iberia or Anatolia, Castille or Byzantium: will the heathens succeed in breaking the iron walls of Christianity to finally breech the interior of Europe?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
BM_ANTIOCH;The First Crusade;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_ANTIOCH_DESC;The Levant reels in the aftermath of the bloody conflict that is the First Crusade. In the north, the Principalities of Antioch and Edessa vie for superiority, both against the Muslims and each other. The Prince of Antioch, Bohemond, is in constant contention with Thoros, the Orthodox Duke of Armenia Minor, whose lands he has usurped. To the south, the infant Kingdom of Jerusalem is balanced against the weakened Fatimid Caliphate, the large Emirate of Damascus, and myriad minor sheikhs dividing it from the Princes to the north. Can the Catholics hold out long enough to unify, or must another Crusade be called to secure a Catholic Holy Land?;;;;;;;;;x,,,
BM_JERUSALEM;Jerusalem at its Height;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_JERUSALEM_DESC;Jerusalem stands strong and proud. The Principality of Antioch has been absorbed and the Kingdom has expanded inland, toward the Sinai peninsula and Damascus. Although Jerusalem's size and strength goes a long way to secure Catholic dominance in the Levant, everything is far from guaranteed. Damascus and Aleppo still stand as guards against the massive Seljuk Sultanate to the East, and the Fatimid Caliph smarts over the losses Egypt suffered during the First Crusade. Jerusalem has many enemies, and few friends. In the distance, a scream for Jihad sounds....;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BM_KOMNENOS;Manuel Komnenos;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_KOMNENOS_DESC;Manuel Komenos reigns in Byzantium, and Hungary looks on in fear. Ever the opportunist, Manuel had long ago concluded a pact with the King of Hungary, István III,whereby István's brother Belá would be educated at the Imperial court in Constantinople. Manuel had as-of-yet been without legitimate male issue, and intended Belá to be married to his daughter Maria, to eventually rule alongside her as Emperor.  Sensing opportunity, however, Manuel decided to move against István and press his son-in-law's claims on the duchies of Dalmatia and Croatia. With those titles secured, Belá is now a landed vassal of Manuel, and the heir to the Kingdoms of Croatia and Hungary. Although the Komnenos line looks as though it may slip from the Imperial seat unless Manuel takes immediate action, the Byzantine Empire stands to grasp the greatest prize it has had in its sights since the Komnenoi took the throne: the buffer between the Holy Roman and Eastern Roman Empires.;;;;;;;;;x,,
BM_SERBIA;Fall of the Komnenoi;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_SERBIA_DESC;The Komnenoi have fallen from the Imperial Throne, and Byzantium is falling with them. The newly-formed Kingdoms of Serbia and Bulgaria have declared their independence from the Byzantine crown, the Seljuk Sultans of Rum press against the Empire's restored borders in Anatolia, and an independent Belá III rules in Hungary-Croatia. All of Manuel Komnenos's dreams have come to naught, but this is a time of opportunity, for those wise enough to see it. Alexios Komnenos, an infant member of the royal Komnenos dynasty, rules in Trebizond. If he can gather support enough to press his claim on Byzantium, the young Komnenos can work to restore the golden age his family's untimely fall from grace brought to a close.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
BM_IBERIA;The Iberian Campaign;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_IBERIA_DESC;Iberia is balanced between the Muslims and Christians. In the north the Catholics divide the land between five Kingdoms: Portugal, León, Castille, Navarra, and Aragón. To the south, the Muslims are unified under the powerful Almohad Sultanate. Is this a time of opportunity and growth for the Christians, or has the Almohad Sultan amassed enough power to finally breach Europe proper?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
BM_TURMOIL_IN_THE_EAST;Turmoil in the East;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_TURMOIL_IN_THE_EAST_DESC;The Fourth Crusade has left Byzantium crippled, and its prior vassal states do not fare much better. Three powerful Dukes vie for control of Greece proper, and only one of them are Greek. The hatred between the Latin and Byzantine Empires has not abated,  but neither has progress been made toward discovering the final victor in their struggle. Glory and titles are there, for a man--or woman--strong enough to seize them.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
BM_FRACTURE;The Fall of Rûm;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_FRACTURE_DESC;Plagued by the Mongols to the east and decadence within itself, the Sultanate of Rûm has collapsed. In its place a half-dozen Sultans have risen, all claiming to be Rûm's true successor. The Byzantine Empire, labored and barely standing, has recovered Constantinople, but its strength to do more than that is in question. Many other lords and lands have interest in the east, not to mention Naples and the still-warring Dukes in Greece, but regardless of if it is desired, this is one man's time. A great nation must rise from the ashes of Rûm--or Byzantium--and whoever succeeds in unifying the disparate peoples of the Aegean shall have power enough to challenge the gateguard of Europe, Hungary.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
BM_SWEDEN;Magnus IV;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_SWEDEN_DESC;Magnus IV, by election King of Sweden and by birthright King of Norway, has temporarily united much of Scandinavia under his rule. Unless Magnus proves to be an exceptional King it is unlikely that the union will live beyond him, but there are those who whisper of an Empire of the North, with Magnus I at its head….;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
BM_ITALY;The Italian Campaign;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_ITALY_DESC;The Holy Roman Empire is in decline, and Italy has finally been completely freed from its grasp. Dukes war with counts, mayors with Doges. Who will unite Italy--or will Italy be united at all?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_SALADIN;Salah ad-Din;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_SALADIN_DESC;Salah ad-Din Yusuf ibn Ayyub--better known to the Western world as Saladin--has taken the throne of Egypt for his own. Previously the servant of the Emir of Damascus, Nur ad-Din, Salah ad-Din has broken with his former benefactor to usurp the Sultanate of Egypt from the Shia Fatimids during a period of crisis, choosing opportunity over longstanding friendship with the Emir, and causing great tension in the Crusader States. Although Salah ad-Din is likely to be preoccupied for a time with the Emir of Aleppo, not to mention his own Shia subjects, it is only a matter of time until the holy warrior turns his eyes toward the states of Jerusalem and Antioch….;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
BM_ANARCHY;The Anarchy;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_ANARCHY_DESC;The Anarchy was a period of early English history in which the dynasty of the Norman conqueror William broke down and was replaced by the cadet house of Plantagenet. It began when the second Norman King of England, Henry I, died without legitimate issue. Although Henry attempted to place his daughter Matilda on the throne, the lords of England would not have it. In his daughter's place, a male descendent of William through the female line, Stephen de Blois, was declared king. Support for Stephen was not absolute, however, and there were many loyalists who sided with Matilda in the succession. Matilda herself was married to the first son of King Foulque of Jerusalem, Geoffrey of Anjou, later to be known as Geoffrey Plantagenet. Geoffrey has managed to conquer Normandy in her name, and the succession crisis between the powerful vassal and the weak King Stephen of England appears to be inevitable.;;;;;;;;;x,,
BM_LITHUANIA;House Gediminaitis Restored;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_LITHUANIA_DESC;After the brief reign of the usurper-king Treniotas, the people of Lithuania have seen fit to restore the house of King Mindaugas to the throne, establishing his first son Vaisvilkas as King. Vaisvilkas has expanded Lithuania to the east, and in so doing has inadvertantly made Lithuania one of the de facto gateguards of Europe alongside the Kings of Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, and the Grand Duke of Novgorod. Although Vaisvilkas's realm is still relatively small, his pious Christianity buys him time and potential support from other Christian rulers.  If he can gain that support and use it to hold off the Mongol horde,the ambitious young King of Lithuania might well be able to recover some of his ancestral lands lost to the Teuton knights….;;;;;;;;;x, ,,,,
BM_HABSBURG;The Habsburgs;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_HABSBURG_DESC;Rudolf von Habsburg, current Holy Roman Emperor, has put down Ottokar II of Bohemia, his only rival for the Imperial throne. With Ottokar's defeat much of his lands have defaulted back to the crown, including the duchy of Österreich, which Rudolf has entrusted to his son, Albricht. Although the succession is secure and a new age has begun with the Habsburg control of Österreich, not all is well in the Empire. The Kingdom of Sicily has broken out of the firm control that Frederick II held it with, and has even begun expanding, conquering much of the coast of Greece and even the Duchy of Provence. Inspired by the succession crisis and Sicily's success, many small states of northern Italy have declared independence. History calls the Habsburgs one of the most successful houses of the Medieval period, but now they face the potential collapse of the Empire's control of the Italian peninsula. Stop the collapse, for the glory of the House of Habsburg!;;;;;;;;;x,
BM_PLANTAGENET;Holy Roman Empire in Turmoil;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_PLANTAGENET_DESC;Richard Plantagenet, through bribes to the German electorate, has been elected as King of the Germans. His election is not a simple one, however. It raises serious questions about the future of the Holy Roman Empire. The powerful Plantagenet England is a strong ally of the Emperor--one that he may need, for the Holy Roman Empire is dangerously imbalanced. Konrad II von Hohenstauffen, King of Sicily and grandson to Frederick Barbarossa, is an independent elector of the Empire, and jealously seeking a return of his family's titles. His control of the Duchy of Swabia means the Kingdom of Sicily has lands in central Germany, weakening the Empire and making Konrad a valid successor. If danger from outside Kings is not enough, Ottokar II of Bohemia has expanded toward the Adriatic sea, massing power and support for his own potential election. Can the House of Plantagenet maintain control through another election?;;;;;;;;;x,,,
BM_CASTILLE;The Union of Castille and León;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_CASTILLE_DESC;Through the untimely death of his brothers, Sancho of Castille has come to inherit his family's divided kingdoms of Galicia and León. Although the crown of Galicia has been declared defunct, Sancho has chosen to retain León and rule it in personal union alongside Castille, crowning himself the Emperor of León-Castilla. With northern Iberia united against the Islamic threat to the south there is greater hope for a Catholic peninsula than before, but nothing is certain. Personal unions can be broken, and Muslims can unite against a common threat just as their Catholic brethren have.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BM_LEVANT;Seljuk Conquest of the Levant;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_LEVANT_DESC;Against even other Muslims the Seljuk horde does not stay its hand. Seeking access to critical Mediterranean trade and control over the holy city of Mecca, Malik I Shah of the Seljuk Sultanate has declared war upon the Fatimid Sultan al-Mustansir, a war that al-Mustansir has lost. Control of the Levant and the holy cities of Mecca and Medina have passed into Seljuk hands, smashing the balance of power in the east and making the Seljuks one of the most powerful states in Eurasia.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
BM_KIEV;Kiev and Novgorod;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_KIEV_DESC;For a brief period, the duchies of Kiev and Novgorod stand balanced in the frigid north of Russia. Both are powerful and both wish to unite the Rus in a more permanent union, but only one can succeed. To the south, problems in Byzantium are alleviated by the fracture of the Seljuk royal house between the seat of Perisa and Rum, but this, too, is an imperfect solution--the Sultanate of Rum is still immensely powerful. Nevertheless, with the immediate pressure of the immensely powerful Seljuk Sultanate diverted from Byzantine possessions, it may be possible to take advantage of the weakened position of the Egyptian Sultan on the North African coast….;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
BM_ALMORAVID;Islam in Retreat;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_ALMORAVID_DESC;The ascension of a young boy to the throne of the Almoravid Sultanate in the west has caused a domino effect of rebellions in its Iberian territories, while the Seljuk Sultanate's decadent collapse, accelerated by the Kingdom of Jerusalem battering at its borders, weakens Islam's unity in the east. Now is the time, servants of Christendom, to take up joyous arms in the name of Christ!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BM_SELJUK;The Collapse of the Seljuks;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_SELJUK_DESC;The Seljuk Sultanate, beset on all sides with enemies and divided internally by decadence, corruption, and incompetence, has finally collapsed. Myriad ex-vassals, remaining members of the Seljuk family, and opportunists stand poised to fight over the remnants. The Sunni Caliph, the Turkish Sultan of Khiva, and untold Emirs, some of them the last remnants of the old Persian elite, all circle the corpse with hunger--who will win the great prize?;;;;;;;;;x,,,
BM_SICILY;Richard and Philippe;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_SICILY_DESC;Richard the Lionheart and Philippe II Auguste stare daggers at one another across the Channel. Through inheritance, bribery, betrayal, and timely conquest the kings of England have been able to occupy well over half of the lands claimed by the French kings, and stand dangerously close to claiming the French crown. Philippe II, known to history as Auguste (Augustus or 'the August'), the monarch that reversed the English conquests and restored French unity and prestige, seems to be in an impossible position--can you replicate his incredible feats? Elsewhere in the world, the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire has claimed the Kingdom of Sicily as his dynastic birthright.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
BM_ALEXIOS;Alexios Komnenos of Trebizond;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_ALEXIOS_DESC;Alexios Komnenos, one of the last remaining members of the Komnenos dynasty, now reigns in his majority in Trebizond. Alexios shares the determination and skill common in his family, and has managed not only to hold Trebizond together in the face of Muslim aggression, but to expand his territory and crown himself Despot. He has not forgotten his claim to the Byzantine Empire, nor has he forgotten his dynasty's golden age upon the throne, lost now to Imperial incompetence and the shameful Fourth Crusade… but perhaps not lost forever. Now is the time for the Komnenoi to reclaim their titles, their honor, their birthright. Now is the time for the return of the rightful Emperors!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
BM_ANUSHTIGINID;The Seljuk Successors;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_ANUSHTIGINID_DESC;The Anushtiginid Sultanate has finally restored a degree of order to Persia by uniting it in as complete a political union as the land has seen since the collapse of the Seljuk Sultanate over 50 years before. Despite great success, the path to glory is not certain for the Anushtiginids. Discontented vassals, and curious rumors of riders to the east are enough to keep any wise Sultan awake through the long nights.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_MALI;Mali United;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_MALI_DESC;The lands that would come to be known as the Empire of Mali have been united under its first Mansa. What this means for the future, and for the safety of the Mauretanian Sultan's southern border, remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_NAPLES;The Sicilian Vespers;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_NAPLES_DESC;In the bloody aftermath of the Sicilian Vespers, a war in which the Aragonese King attempted to assert his claim to the Kingdom of Sicily, the southern Italian peninsula is divided. The Kingdom of Trinacria has been proclaimed on the island of Sicily, with the brother of the Aragonese King ruling, and claiming rights to the entirety of the kingdom. On the mainland, the old king of Sicily, now absent his title's namesake, has instead crowned himself the King of Naples, and looks with jealousy on the island that should by rights be his. Both sides of the conflict have powerful allies, the king of Trinacria protected by the Kings of Aragon and Castille, and the king of Naples supported by Hungary-Croatia--a new war will noy be an easy one. Also on the Iberian peninsula, Philippe IV Capet has come to inherit the Kingdom of Navarra, and can likewise be counted in the Iberian struggle. Who will move when, and what will they move against?;;;;;;;;;x
BM_ILKHANATE;The Ilkhanate Converts!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_ILKHANATE_DESC;The Ilkhanate's Khan has converted to Shia Islam!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_POLAND;The Polish-Bohemian Union;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_POLAND_DESC;Due to the untimely death of the Polish monarch without a favorable heir, Vaclav II Premyslid of Bohemia has been crowned king in place of another Piast. This gives Vaclav--heir to Ottokar, and all the desire for revenge against the von Hohenstauffens that comes with being his son--a great deal of power in Europe. If Vaclav is given time to consolidate and expand it is unlikely the Holy Roman Empire will ever be able to reassert its authority over Bohemia, with its control of the Italian peninsula already crumbling. The time to move is now!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
BM_GH;The Golden Horde Converts!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_GH_DESC;The Khan of the Golden Horde has converted to Sunni Islam!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_LITHUANIA_FORMED;Lithuania Unites!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_LITHUANIA_FORMED_DESC;With the Teutonic Order occupying their historic lands in the West and the Golden Horde destroying the Rurikovich to the East, the myriad tribes of Lithuania have finally seen fit to unite under one king for their better protection, by necessity. Mindaugas I is a strong ruler, but his kingdom is not. Lacking many of his historic lands, those having been usurped by the Teutonic Order, and being only a few petty duchies away from a full border with the Golden Horde, his fitness will be tested in the coming days. Not only does Lithuania have a vassalage of mixed religions, some Romuva and some Catholic, Mindaugas's own children are divided in their worship even from his own faith, with his son and heir Vaisvilkas an Orthodox Christian and his second son Daumantas a Romuvan. To secure his lands and carve a future for the Lithuanian people, Mindaugas must calm the religious tension in his realm while seeking alliances to help him in recovering his people's ancestral land. For Lietuva!;;;;;;;;;x,,,
BM_MONGOL_SPLIT;The Golden Horde and Ilkhanate;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_MONGOL_SPLIT_DESC;Following the death of the great Khan Ghengis, his realm has split between his heirs. His grandson Batu rules in the north as the Golden Horde, while his youngest son Tolui rules in the south as the Ilkhanate. Although the division of these realms may well make the Mongol menace weaker on the offensive, their dynastic alliance will certainly make what lands they have already claimed nigh-impenetrable….;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
BM_TWO_ERIKS;The War of the Two Eriks;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_TWO_ERIKS_DESC;On the death of King Stenkil I, his son Erik ascended the throne of Sweden as Erik II. As soon as the young Erik II ascended the throne, Erik III of Uppland declared a war to place himself, youngest--and bastard--son of King Emundr I, on the throne in a conflict which would come to be known as the War of the Two Eriks. Erik II is Catholic, whereas Erik III is Norse, one of the last living remnants of the old faith. Can Erik III restore the Norse religion and the rule of his house to a land that has abandoned both?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
BM_SARTAQ_KHAN;Sartaq Khan the Nestorian;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_SARTAQ_KHAN_DESC;Sartaq Khan has become Khagan of the Golden Horde, but his reign is unstable and almost certainly doomed to fail. Sartaq is a Nestorian Christian, a heathen to his fellow Mongols and a heretic to his Orthodox vassals. There is minimal support for his reign throughout the Golden Horde… but perhaps there need not be. Realms that have been battered by warfare, either by the Horde itself or other Muslims, will inevitably look toward Sartaq's ascension--heretic or not--as a beacon in a time of darkness. If Sartaq can retain his rule long enough to form marriage ties with strong European realms, his rule and his faith might be beaten into his reluctant vassals.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
