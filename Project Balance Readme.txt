What the modules available on day 0 in-game do:
- Gender Equality - People of both genders can staff all council positions and command armies. All non-Muslim realms start with Absolute Cognatic succession
- No Ahistorical Empires: Only two empires have dejure land; Byzantium and the HRE
- Shattered Balance: All counties are independent. Perfect if you want alt-history or to expand as a specific dynasty. Note: Not compatible with No Assaults
