What the modules do:
- Gender Equality - People of both genders can staff all council positions and command armies. All non-Muslim realms start with Absolute Cognatic succession (Note: not compatible with SWMH)
- No Assaults - Holdings cannot be assaulted during sieges
- Vanilla Demesne Laws - Vanilla demesne laws are restored, rather than Project Balance's new set of demesne laws. Crown laws are unaffected
- No Ahistorical Empires: Only two empires have dejure land; Byzantium and the HRE
- Shattered Balance: All counties are independent. Perfect if you want alt-history or to expand as a specific dynasty. Note: Not compatible with No Assaults
